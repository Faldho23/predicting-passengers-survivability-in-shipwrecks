# Brief Description

This project utilizes machine learning (SVM and Logistic Regression) to predict passenger survivability in shipwrecks. 
The goal is to optimize rescue efforts by focusing on individuals who need immediate medical attention, ultimately increasing 
overall survival rates.

# Project Setup and Execution

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:
## Step 1: Extract the Zipped Folder

### Folder Structure

After extraction, you will find two main folders:

- **src**: Contains the code file and models.
- **data**: Contains graphs and the dataset used by the code.

## Step 2: Access the Code File

Navigate to the `src` folder and open `disaster_svm_logreg_classification.ipynb`.

### Running the Code

(Optional) Run all the cells in the Jupyter notebook to generate the results.

### Model Saving (Optional)

Towards the end of the code file, you'll find a commented cell explaining how to save the model if necessary.
